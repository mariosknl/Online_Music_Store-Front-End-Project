**Capstone Project** - *Online Shop for Music Instruments*

Created an online shop layout by using the design idea of **Mohammed Awad** on Behance. I followed the standar preferences as showed in the official template like using certain fonts/ Typography and also the basic colors. Last but not least the basic layout is based on this template.
